  default: Rev. Jon Goold was struck down by blinding light one night after an evening
    of drunkenness and debauchery. He then heard a benevolent voice tell him that
    he was to start the greatest old-timey country western band that no one has ever
    heard of, and that he should recruit his foolish wife and brothers to join him
    in this fruitless endeavour. Thus the Handsome Devils were born.
